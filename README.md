# DS-Theorems
My DS Cheat Sheet. If you want to use them for yourself, you'll probably have to change a few things in the TeX files and recompile them again. 

There are some inaccuracies in them that I am too lazy to fix at this point. If you want to fix them, create a new pull request for them and I might add them to the repository

If you want some help in how to make changes to it, here are a few resources for it
* Overleaf 30 minute LaTeX guide - https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes
* TikZit for making graphs - https://tikzit.github.io/
* For making tables more easily(cuz they can be a pain) - https://www.tablesgenerator.com/#

## I don't care about all of this, tell me how to make this my own

Put your name [here](https://github.com/Anirudh-S-Kumar/DS-Theorems/blob/d316a088589f3485376cc13147e46efddf515328/main.tex#L24) and [here](https://github.com/Anirudh-S-Kumar/DS-Theorems/blob/d316a088589f3485376cc13147e46efddf515328/main.tex#L76) and you are done

### Owner's note

It is highly advisable to use this only as a reference. The Process of making the actual cheat sheet is much more important than the final result. However, I understand not everyone is crazy like me to make them in $\LaTeX$, so here's a resource for you
